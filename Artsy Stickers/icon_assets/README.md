# iOS10 iMessage Stickers Icon Template for Sketch

This is a simple Sketch template with designated Artboards for all the necessary icon sizes that Xcode requires for Stickers apps for iOS 10.

I've tried to label all the Artboards so that when exporting assets, the naming convention would make it super simple to match icons to Xcode.
