## Using the Eigen Beta

You can switch between staging and production environments via the admin menu mentioned below though. This means that data may have differences, as staging is copied from production once a week. However, being on staging means you can't break anything ;)

While on staging, the bottom tab bar of the app is purple. This lets us know which environment a screenshot was taken on.

### The admin menu

You can access the admin menu in two ways:

- If logged in as an admin, shake your device.
- Otherwise, go to Safari and type `artsy:///admin` into the address bar (note the triple-slash).

The admin menu is comprised of several sections:

- Useful actions, for example switching between staging and production
- Lab settings, which are toggles for specific features within Eigen
- Developer API settings (useful for web/platform developers)
